# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Christmas game central

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Christmas-themed website with fun holiday games for all ages, designed to capture
the festive spirit with easy gameplay and cheerful visuals

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our project is a Christmas-themed website inspired by Cool Math Games. It will have a
few holiday-themed games to entertain users in a festive way. The games will include
"Christmas Memory Match", "Snowman Stack", and "Santa’s Sleigh Puzzle", all with
cheerful visuals and holiday music. We’ll use Python with Flask for the back end and
HTML/CSS for the front end. The site will have features like score tracking and a
user-friendly interface. With a small, family-friendly game selection, this site will offer a
simple, joyful holiday experience for users of all ages.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No, we are not planning to combine our final project with another course.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good result for our project will be a working, easy-to-use Christmas-themed 
website with some fun holiday games, score tracking, and festive visuals and
sounds to make users happy.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better result for our project would be a well-made Christmas-themed website
with several holiday games, a design that works on both desktop and mobile,
user accounts to save high scores, and a simple rewards system to unlock
festive items or levels.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

For the best outcome, we want to make a Christmas-themed website with
several holiday games, smooth use on mobile and desktop, user accounts to
track scores, a simple rewards system to unlock holiday items, and festive
visuals and music to make the holiday experience better.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TOur next steps are to use Python and HTML to set up the website's basic
structure. Python and Flask will handle user accounts, score tracking, and game
progress, while HTML and CSS will create the festive front-end layout. We'll need
to improve our Python skills for server-side tasks and learn more about HTML
and CSS for design, as well as add basic JavaScript for interactive game
elements. If working with two classmates, one can focus on the Python back-end
and Flask framework, another can work on the HTML and CSS front-end layout,
and the third can develop the game logic using Python. By dividing tasks, we'll
work efficiently and stay on track to complete the project.
