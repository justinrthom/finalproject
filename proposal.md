# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Slither Quest

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Snake Game is an arcade game where players get to control a snake which then can grow by eating a
apple or the game can end by hitting the walls, itself, or other obstacles 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project is an arcade Snake Game inspired by the original Snake Game online. I will use Python to make this game. 
It will include a snake which grows as you eat the apple which is scattered across the game and regenerates in
a new spot as the snake eats one. It continues to grow and the objective of the game is to 
keep the snake growing and not hit the borders or itself. If the snake hits the borders or 
itself then the game ends. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No, I am  not planning to combine my final project with another course.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am not planning on collaborating with any classmates for the final project

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good result for my project will be a working, easy-to-use Snake Game
just like the one that is on Google and other search engines. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better result for my project would be a well-made Snake Game which has 
different colors for the snake and apple. Maybe a different font for the score
will also be a nice addition to have.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

For the best outcome, I want to make the Snake Game as smooth as possible
giving users an enjoyable experience to play this arcade game and relive childhood 
experiences when playing this game. I want users to be hooked onto the game from 
how entertaing the game will be.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some new skills I would need to acquire is figuring out how to make the 
apples in the game regenerate when the snake eats it. This allows the game
to run smoothly and get the most out of what my goal is with the game. I will 
need to research how to do that and how to do that in Python. Python will 
be the main language of code that I will be using in order to create this 
game. By doing that I can stay up to date with my project and submit it 
according to the deadline and have a project that I am genuinely proud of 
submitting.
