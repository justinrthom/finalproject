Some adverseries I faced were that I was doing this project solo
so I had to figure out how to make this game on my own. I followed the tutorial
from the link above which helped me a lot. 

I tried to customize the game to make it my own version by adding a new color
wave and a different score font

I genuienly really enjoyed making this project because I was able to recreate one 
of my most favorite arcade game that I used to always play during my childhood even up to now.
